# gesture_control_bot
Engineering Exploration Project for freshman Engineering at KLE Technological University. Gesture control bot uses arduino as platform with ADXL335 and RF transmitter/receiver module to detect gesture and transmit signal for movement.

The project will be completed in 3 sprints using the agile framework 
Sprint 1 consists of using the ADXL335 accelerometer mounted on a glove and connected to Arduino nano to detect various gesture orientations and desplay on the Serial Monitor.

Sprint 2 consists of building the chassis of the car and using the 443 Mhz Transmitter / Receiver module to transmit and receive the signals from the ADXL335 accelerometer and move the bot appropriately using 2 200RPM DC motors at the back of the bot.

Sprint 3 consists of detecting obstacle with the help of IR sensor and sounding a notification alarm which notifies the user of the obstacle ahead.
